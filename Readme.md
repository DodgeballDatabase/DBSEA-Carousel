# DBSEA-Carousel

Work around the lack of a cover that can link in Wordpress and maintain consistency when using an image alone and with overlay, filters, and text.

Documentation is minimal but can be expanded as needed.

## Usage
Specify instance parameters for your slide, add it to the list of slides to generate, and copy the generated html to the "custom html" on wordpress.

## Testing
This tool also generates an html page with all slides stacked vertically to test that everything looks as expected without needing access to wordpress.
